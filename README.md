OSP "Makefile" for Windows
--------------------------

This batch file is a port of [Dr. Rose][dr-rose]'s makefile for the OSP projects.


## Story

Up to this point, Windows users have had to type in all the Java commands for the OSP projects by hand.
I use Windows often enough for this to be irritating, so I finally sat down one afternoon and hacked out this batch file to save me some typing.


## Command List

The batch file allows all of the same commands as the makefile.
It also preserves dependencies between commands, just like in the makefile.

    build -- Builds the OSP project.
    run   -- Builds and runs the OSP project on the command line (no GUI).
    gui   -- Builds and runs the OSP project with the windowed GUI.
    demo  -- Runs the Professor's solution.
    debug -- Fires up jdb to help debug an OSP project.
    clean -- Removes temporary files generated by build and run.
